We can see from the table that there are only 3 players that fit the parameters I have set, that being Bruno Fernandes, Kevin De Bruyne and Martinelli.

Immediately we can see that Bruno Fernandes has 9 penalty goals in 10 attempts which, although showing he is an effective penalty taker, will have a large impact on his xG.
Therefore I would say that despite his numbers being impressive, xG in this instance is not a strong indication of his effectiveness in open play.

Martinelli is another interesting player, as he is only 19 years old and is putting up similar xG and xA numbers to the elite players alongside him. 
However, the sample size of data for Martinelli is too small, as we can see he only played 589 minutes, so the figures he has produced cannot be relied upon too heavily.
More data is required to make a decision on Martinelli.

Kevin De Bruyne is the standout player within our table, he has an xG/90 mins of 0.44 and an xA/90 mins of 0.46, despite only scoring 2 of 3 penalties.
Unfortunately, his age is a major factor when considering a transfer, he was 29 at the time of this data being collected, which means it is likely he will only have a few years left before considering retirement.
In addition to this, he plays for Manchester City, is a key player, and would come at a premium price.

Unfortunately, my analysis leaves us without any transfer targets, but we would like to keep an eye on Martinelli. 
I will need to expand our parameters in order to identify young talent with potential to become an elite player.
