Hello,

This short, basic SQL code has been completed in order to clean up a table of data of statistics from the EPL 2020/21 season.

The main aim is to see which players are the most threatening in both xG per 90 mins and xA per 90 mins, and identify which of these players would make very interesting transfer targets.

I will look at the players that have both xG and xG > 0.3.

Thank you
